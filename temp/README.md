# The `temp` folder
This folder will hold files that are temporarily generated while either creating a Yukari TTS file, or composing a NIED earthquake map.

The folder must be present, but you can change its location -- by default, this folder is used by the config.json keys `niedImageTempPath` and `yukariTempPath`.
